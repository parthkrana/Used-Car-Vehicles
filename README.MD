# Hotel Database Analysis Project for DSC341
## In this project I created a Hotel Database

#### Summary

This assignment was for IT320 at DePaul University and taught me how to use a number of foundational SQL concepts, as outlined below:

1. Learned how to apply SQL clauses to perform the following:
* Grouping operations
* Calculations
* Aggregate functions
* Sorting techniques

2. Utilized the relational algebra concepts intrinsic in SQL for processing multiple tables using joins and or sub-queries.

3. Analyzed the requests to identify the tables, attributes, selection, and join criteria.

In completing the assignment, I used SQL queries, operations, and calculations to understand data on hotel guests, which included names, phone numbers, addresses, room reservations, and more.

Analyzing this information allowed me to identify how to forward phone calls to certain guest rooms and total company revenue based on room reservations and individual room rates. The revenue query is shown in the code sample below:
